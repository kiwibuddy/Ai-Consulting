## Market Reality (Pressure-Tested)

**Section eyebrow:**  
Market Reality (Pressure-Tested)

**Intro:**  
Most AI consultants come from corporate tech. I come from 20+ years in global missions, biblical education, and cross-cultural program development—building technology solutions that serve people, not profit margins.

Across NZ, faith, nonprofit, and education sectors, I consistently see the same constraints:

**Bullets:**
- Limited budgets and overstretched staff
- High trust and safeguarding requirements (especially around vulnerable populations)
- Low tolerance for technical risk and experimental failures
- Strong values, weak systems—leaders who know their mission but lack tools
- Genuine curiosity about AI, legitimate fear of misuse and unintended harm

**Closing:**  
Most AI consultants are built for corporates. This practice is not.

This work is designed for organisations where **people matter more than margins**, where **trust is non-negotiable**, and where technology must serve formation, not exploitation.
