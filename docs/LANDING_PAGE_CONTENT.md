## Market Reality (Pressure-Tested)

**Section eyebrow:**  
Market Reality (Pressure-Tested)

**Intro:**  
Across NZ, faith, nonprofit, and education sectors, I consistently see the same constraints:

**Bullets:**
- Limited budgets and overstretched staff
- High trust and safeguarding requirements
- Low tolerance for technical risk
- Strong values, weak systems
- Curiosity about AI, fear of misuse

**Closing:**  
Most AI consultants are built for corporates. This practice is not. This work is designed for organisations where people matter more than margins.
