# Roadmap: Map your landing page to a Tesoro-style theme

This roadmap maps your current [landing page](https://www.tesoroxp.com) content and structure to design, animation, UI, and UX patterns from [Tesoro XP](https://www.tesoroxp.com), so you can try a new theme while keeping your message and conversion goals.

## 1. Tesoro site review (design, animation, UI, UX)

### 1.1 Structure and content patterns

| Tesoro element | Purpose |
|----------------|--------|
| **Hero** | One strong H1, short subhead with a single emphasised line (“Everyone wins.”), one sentence value prop, no secondary CTA in hero. |
| **Flow strip** | Four steps in a row: Connect → Activate → Spend → Reward. Each step: label + one line. Horizontal, scannable, no cards. |
| **Audience blocks** | Three segments: “for the Merchant”, “for the Game Studio”, “for the Gamer”. Each: small label (“for the Merchant”), H2, image (full-width or large), body copy, single “Learn more” CTA. Feels like three “mini-landing” blocks. |
| **Footer** | Newsletter (email + submit), minimal links (Credits, Terms, Privacy), production credit, copyright. |
| **Nav** | Minimal: Merchants, Game Studios, Gamers, Join the Waitlist. No dropdowns. |

### 1.2 Design and aesthetic

- **Typography:** Large, bold H1; clear hierarchy (H1 → H2 → body). Likely a single strong sans-serif.
- **Layout:** Full-bleed sections, generous whitespace, content centred or with clear grid. Images used as full-width or large panels, not small thumbnails.
- **Colour:** Appears dark or high-contrast with limited palette; CTAs stand out.
- **Motion / animation:** Common patterns on this kind of site: scroll-triggered fade-in or slide-up, smooth scroll, possibly subtle parallax. No heavy carousels in the main flow.
- **UI:** Buttons/links are simple (“Learn more”, “Join the Waitlist”). No card clutter; more “statement + image + one CTA” per block.

### 1.3 UX takeaways

- One primary CTA per section.
- Clear audience segmentation (“for the Merchant / Studio / Gamer”) with dedicated blocks.
- Simple step flow for “how it works” (Connect → Activate → Spend → Reward).
- Minimal nav; main journey is scroll + “Learn more” / primary CTA.

## 2. Content mapping: your page → Tesoro-style elements

Your current sections and how they map to Tesoro-style blocks:

| Your current section | Tesoro-style element | Mapping notes |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Hero** (Practical AI… + Free 30-min AI Clarity Call) | Tesoro hero (H1 + subhead + one CTA) | Keep: one H1, one short subhead, one primary CTA. Add: one bold short line (e.g. “You’ll know what to use, what to avoid, and what matters next.”) as the “Everyone wins.”-style beat. Drop or de-emphasise secondary CTA in hero. |
| **Problems I solve** (2-col: card + image) | No direct equivalent; could become a “statement strip” | Option A: Single full-width statement strip: “The risk isn’t AI adoption. The risk is accidental adoption without discernment.” with optional short subline. Option B: Keep 2-col but simplify to one headline + one line + one image (Tesoro uses big imagery per block). |
| **How I help** (3 outcomes) | Connect / Activate / Spend / Reward flow | Turn into a **horizontal step strip**: 3 steps (e.g. Clarity & guardrails → Practical systems → Training & adoption). Each: step label + one line. No cards; just typography and spacing. Optional: light connector line or icons between steps. |
| **Who this is for** (one card in combined section) | “for the Merchant / Game Studio / Gamer” blocks | Turn into **3 audience blocks**: “for Churches & mission”, “for Schools & training”, “for Nonprofits & NGOs”. Each block: small “for the …” label, H2, one short paragraph, optional large image, single “Learn more” or “Book a call” CTA. Full-width or near full-width sections. |
| **Why work with me** (one card in combined section) | Could merge into audience blocks or one “About” block | Option A: One “About” block (like one of the “for the …” blocks): H2 “Why work with me”, body = your 5 bullets as short paragraphs or list, one CTA. Option B: Short “Why me” line under each audience block. |
| **Portfolio** (3 items) | Proof / social proof | Tesoro doesn’t show a classic portfolio. Map to: one “Proof” or “Built for mission” section: 3 items as logos + one line each, or one headline + 3 short case lines, or a single “How we work” visual. Keep content; simplify to headline + 3 proof points. |
| **Get started** | Join the Waitlist / primary CTA | One full-width CTA block: headline (“Get started” / “Start with a conversation”), one line, one button (“Book a Free 30-minute AI Clarity Call”). Optional: simple form (e.g. email) or “Contact” link only. |
| **Footer** | Tesoro footer | Newsletter (email + submit), Tauranga NZ + contact, Credits/Terms/Privacy, optional “Site by …”. |

## 3. Suggested implementation order

1. **Theme base**  
   - Colours: pick a dark or high-contrast palette (e.g. dark bg + light text, or strong accent for CTAs).  
   - Typography: one bold sans-serif for headings and body (e.g. one Google Font).  
   - Spacing: increase section padding and max-width for a more “Tesoro” feel.

2. **Hero**  
   - Single H1, one subhead, one bold short line, one primary CTA.  
   - Remove or move “See the challenge” to a scroll hint or nav.

3. **Problems**  
   - Either: one full-width statement strip (headline + closing line).  
   - Or: one 2-col block (headline + one line + one large image), no bullet list in hero area.

4. **How I help → step strip**  
   - Replace 3 cards with a horizontal 3-step strip (labels + one line each).  
   - Optional: scroll-triggered fade-in or stagger.

5. **Who this is for + Why work with me → audience blocks**  
   - Three full-width blocks: “for Churches & mission”, “for Schools & training”, “for Nonprofits & NGOs”.  
   - Each: “for the …” label, H2, body, optional image, one CTA.  
   - Add one “Why work with me” block (or merge into a 4th block) with your 5 bullets and one CTA.

6. **Portfolio → proof**  
   - One section: headline + 3 proof points (same content as current portfolio items, simplified).  
   - Optional: logos or one hero image instead of 3 cards.

7. **Get started**  
   - One CTA block + one button; optional email signup.

8. **Footer**  
   - Newsletter, location/contact, minimal links, credit line.

9. **Nav**  
   - Reduce to: Problems (or “The challenge”), How I help, Who it’s for (or “For you”), Portfolio/Proof, Get started. Single primary CTA (“Free AI Clarity Call” or “Book a call”).

10. **Animation and polish**  
    - Scroll-triggered fade-in or slide-up for sections.  
    - Smooth scroll for anchor links.  
    - Optional: subtle parallax on one hero or audience image.  
    - Ensure one primary CTA per section and consistent button style.

## 4. What to keep from your current page

- All **copy** (headlines, bullets, CTAs): reuse in the new layout.  
- **Conversion goal**: primary CTA = “Book a Free 30-minute AI Clarity Call” (or “Free AI Clarity Call”) → `/intake`.  
- **Audience clarity**: Churches & mission, Schools & training, Nonprofits & NGOs.  
- **Proof**: Global Bible Platform, Education & Training Platforms, AI-Enabled Tools & Workflows (as proof points, not necessarily as 3 cards).

---

## 5. Quick reference: Tesoro patterns to adopt

- One primary CTA per section.  
- “for the [Audience]” blocks with label + H2 + image + one CTA.  
- Horizontal step strip for “how it works” (no cards).  
- Full-width or large imagery per block.  
- Minimal nav and footer.  
- Bold typography and clear hierarchy.  
- Scroll-triggered fade-in / slide-up; smooth scroll.

Use this roadmap when implementing the Tesoro-style theme; your save point is documented in `docs/SAVE_AND_RESTORE_LANDING.md` so you can restore the current design at any time.
